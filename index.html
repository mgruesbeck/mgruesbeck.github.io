    <h1>Melvin Gruesbeck</h1>
<p>Head of Operations</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m currently Head of Operations at <a href="https://www.profluent.bio/">Profluent</a>, a startup developing machine learning models that can read and write biomolecules. I discovered operations as a prototype designer when I realized designing user flows was analogous to designing business processes.</p>
<p>As a prototype designer I worked in a computer vision and NLP setting, first as an early <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/04/salesforce-buys-hot-deep-learning-startup-metamind-services-shutting-down-may-4/">MetaMind</a> employee, and later as a founding member of <a href="https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/">Salesforce Research</a>. Prior to that, I founded a design agency in Napa Valley.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, I love thinking about culture, incentives, systems, and tasks. And, how each relates to products, processes, and the people that interact with them. I get work done with: 11ty, Figma, Git, Javascript, Node, SVG, Unix, Notion, Rippling and more.</p>
<p>On weekends I <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/e35yJdgKN3BokrWK6">ski</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8zGVx0idn4PJfGxyta_36Oga0kMZm5m3He03T-JCc/edit">mountaineer</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qS1YrDbS81k5DmFj9">paraglide</a>, and make nerdy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140L1GhbZXHXsbJdI6eYurpDyTWKa8owp57K_modYM7w/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheets</a>.</p>
